# Hotel_management
The objective of this project is to design and implement a Hotel Room Booking System using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project aims to simulate how real hotel reservation systems operate, focusing on clear class structures, interaction between objects, and proper application of core OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

This system allows users to view different types of rooms, check their availability, and make bookings in a structured and realistic manner. Each room type—Standard, Deluxe, and Suite—is modeled as a separate class with specialized features, demonstrating the use of inheritance and method overriding. A central BookingManager class handles the coordination of reservations, manages room allocation, and ensures that rooms cannot be double-booked.

The project also aims to showcase clean code organization, separation of responsibilities, and simulation of real-world workflows within a hotel environment. Although simplified, the system reflects the logic used in actual hotel management software, making it a strong learning-based project. Through this implementation, the objective is to demonstrate practical application of OOP for solving real-life problems while building a foundation that can later be extended into a full backend or integrated with a frontend UI.
